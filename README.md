# GifTastic

This application allows users to view gifs from Giphy, based on an emotion. Users can click on the existing buttons, or by entering an emotion into the text box and selecting the submit button, they can view gifs for that new emotion.

The application utilizes the Giphy API to pull in the gifs. 

Development was completed by Alex Henderson and is deployed here: https://anh0238.github.io/GifTastic/
